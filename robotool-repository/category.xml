   <!-- WARNING:  This file should be in sync with ../robotool-product/RoboTool.product, 
                  so that the features listed there are also included in this p2 repository.

                  The idea is that this is the standalone repository to serve as the update
                  site for a RoboTool product release. The maven module 'robotool-product'
                  needs its own separate P2 repository that includes every transitive
                  dependency to enable local installation, and therefore, packaging of
                  RoboTool.

        TODO: Add all categories here.
