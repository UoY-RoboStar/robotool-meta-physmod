      #       RoboTool compiled and packaged as an Eclipse product using Eclipse tycho's Maven builder. 

      #       Note that binaries are not signed. In particular, when downloaded and extracted under macOS may need [dequarantining](https://superuser.com/questions/526920/how-to-remove-quarantine-from-file-permissions-in-os-x) using the command `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine Eclipse.app` to avoid a message saying that the binary is damaged.
